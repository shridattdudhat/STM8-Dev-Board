# STM8S003

The STM8S003 is almost identical to the STM8S103. The only difference I am
aware of is the size of the EEPROM: 128 bytes vs. 640 bytes.

I am not sure why the '003 is sold for half the price, or, to put it the
other way around, why anybody should choose the '103 at all. Did I miss an
important difference?

All you have to do in order to develop for the STM8S003 is setting the board
manager for '[Generic STM8S103 breakout board](stm8blue.md)'. Just keep in
mind not to use EEPROM locations above 127/0x7f.

All differences between the CPUs:

Feature		| STM8S003	| STM8S103
------------	| -------------	| ------------
EEPROM size	| 128 Bytes	| 640 Bytes



## Known development boards

I am not aware of any dedicated STM8S003 breakout board, but this CPU is
used in many other low-cost boards:

- [ESP-14](esp14.md) Wifi-Module
- [W1209](w1209-thermostat.md) Temperature controller
- HC-12 Wireless serial remote module

wiki](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/STM8S-Value-Line-Gadgets) lists
